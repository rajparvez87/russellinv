Coding challenge by Russell Investments

I have fixed the bugs and introudced the new Conjured item in the existing code provided in the challgenge. However I saw an opportunity to rewrite the whole solution in a more object oriented fashion and took the liberty to do so. 

I have commented out the existing UpdateInventory method which has the fixes asked in the challenge description.
New UpdateInventory method utilized a new model created under namespace GR.Models
